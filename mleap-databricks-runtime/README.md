# MLeap Databricks Runtime

This is a simple facade around the `mleap-databricks-runtime-fat` submodule. This module is
used to deploy artifacts to maven for easy access. The POM file generated from this module
has no dependencies itself, as all of the dependencies are either provided by the Databricks
ML Runtime or are included/shaded in the assembly JAR generated by `mleap-databricks-runtime-fat`.

See the README.md file in `mleap-databricks-runtime-fat` and `mleap-databricks-runtime-testkit`
for more information.
